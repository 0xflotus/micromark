  <b>a new, tiny, and fast, markdown parser <br> written in TypeScript under the unified umbrella</br></b>
</p>


## Whatâ€™s micromark
Something like [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) (*markdown processor powered by plugins based on [unified][unified]*), but on a lower level: a [lexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) (in nerdy terms ðŸ¤“). Syntax trees have many good things, but they do come with the downside of having a big memory footprint and sometimes being more than what you need.

**We're launching micromark as just an idea. The first line of code still needs to be written. But we imagine it to be**:

*    **small** in file size, max 10 kB minzipped, and tiny in memory use
*    **fast** in speed, compared to existing parsers on real world documents
*    **safe** to use, it should safely work on untrusted content by default
*    **compliant** to CommonMark but **extendible** for GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown), MDX, etc.
*    **complete**, in that it should give access to all info in the source document

*But it's not:*

*    something that creates HTML and the like: other projects use micromark for that
*    something that creates a syntax tree: remark will use it to do just that

## How will it be used?
**micromark will be part of [unified][unified].** But it will likely not be something you'd directly interact with, unless you're interested in working on parsers, but it will make high-level tooling better.

Evolving unified shouldn't just be about new high-level features but also about rethinking core mechanisms. **That's where micromark comes in, so unified can build the most friendly, secure, fast, and extensive bridges between content formats.**
